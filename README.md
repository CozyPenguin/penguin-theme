# Penguin Theme for VS Code

I created this theme because I wasn't satisfied with the themes available. I found that most of the ones I liked had no support for semantic highlighting, a feature I think is great.

The Penguin theme is by far not complete and I still have to work on adding support for more languages and tokens, as well as do some fine tuning on the colours and *change some of them completely*. This means that the feel of the theme may change in the future.
